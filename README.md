# Heart Failure Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing heart failure data to explore various factors that may influence patient outcomes. The analysis is carried out using a dataset that includes patient demographics, medical history, and various clinical measurements.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project contains information about patients admitted with heart failure. It includes various features such as patient ID, gender, admission year, age at admission, length of stay, primary insurance, potassium levels, and history of certain medical conditions.

### Key Features:
- **Patient_ID:** Unique identifier for each patient.
- **Gender:** Male or Female.
- **Admission Year:** The year in which the patient was admitted.
- **Age At Admission:** The patient's age at the time of admission.
- **Length of Stay (Days):** The number of days the patient stayed in the hospital.
- **Primary Insurance:** The type of insurance the patient has.
- **Potassium Levels:** First and last potassium levels recorded during the admission.
- **Medical History:** Includes history of ventilation, catheterization, renal failure, diabetes, and other conditions.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several sections:

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - Import necessary libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
   - Load the dataset and perform initial exploration.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Convert data types as necessary.
   - Feature engineering to create new variables.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyze the distribution of key variables.
   - Visualize relationships between variables using plots and charts.

4. **Modeling and Predictions:**
   - Apply statistical or machine learning models to predict patient outcomes.
   - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

5. **Results and Conclusion:**
   - Summarize findings from the analysis.
   - Discuss potential implications and limitations of the study.

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

To install these libraries, run:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure all required libraries are installed.
3. Open the `heart_failure_assignment_draft.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
4. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Results
The analysis reveals several important factors influencing heart failure outcomes, including age, length of stay, potassium levels, and history of certain medical conditions.
